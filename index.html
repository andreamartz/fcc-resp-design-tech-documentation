      <p>Relax, this is not a grammar lesson, but really you should learn about modals. In web development, the term modal
        refers to a window that pops up at a time we specify or when a certain event happens on the web page. Sometimes 
        animations accompany the image to transition it onto the page rather than having it appear abruptly. The window is 
        usually a call-to-action (CTA) and is often shown with a darkened backdrop in order to draw attention to the modal. Here is an
        example from Designmodo.com of how a modal might be implemented on a retail website:
        <a href="https://designmodo.com/design-modal-windows/" style="display:block;text-align:center;padding:1rem 0">
          <img style="width:85%" src="img/modal-example.JPG"
            alt="image and link to an article showing examples of modal windows">
        </a>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="what_you_should_already_know" class="main-section">
      <header>
        <h2>What you should already know</h2>
      </header>
      <p>You will get the most out of this lesson if you...
        <ul>
          <li>...understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS) and</li>
          <li>...are familiar with the DOM (Document Object Model)</li></li>
        </ul>
        If you have this knowledge, let’s get to it!
      </p>
      <p>It is recommended that you open a code editor and try to create this modal step-by-step with me. Even better, try to add
      to the code or change it to make it your own.v</p>

    <section id="planning_for_the_modal" class="main-section">
      <header>
        <h2>Planning for the modal</h2>
      </header>
      <p>As is always the case in web development, before you begin coding, you should think about the specific behavior you
      desire for your modal in terms of what is right for your audience (the user). Specifically, answer the following
      questions:
        <ol>
          <li><em>What event will trigger the display of the modal?</em> That is, when do you want the modal to appear? Will it be when the
          user clicks or hovers over an element on the page? Will it happen a few seconds after the page has loaded?</li>
          <li><em>What event will trigger the disappearance of the modal?</em>Will it be when the user clicks a close button on the modal? Or by clicking anywhere on the backdrop?</li>
          <li><em>What transitions, if any, will the modal have as it enters onto the page?</em>That is, will it bounce a little? Will it slide onto the page? Something else?</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="the_goal" class="main-section">
      <header>
        <h2>The goal</h2>
      </header>
      <p>In this article, I will show you how to create a very basic modal with no transitions as it comes onto the page. You can
      always add the fancy features later. It will be activated by clicking on a specific image on the page. The act of the
      user clicking on the image is called an event in JS. As a bonus, I will also show you how to make a modal pop up after a
      slight delay when the page loads.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="the_code" class="main-section">
      <header>
        <h2>The code</h2>
      </header>
      <p>The modal we’ll create will be the one that appears in the header image of this article. The code will make more sense
      if you understand first how the modal is constructed. You can think of it as having three layers. The bottom layer is
      the image of the mountains. When the page loads, this image without the modal is all you’ll see:
        <p style="text-align:center">
          <img style="width:85%" src="img/kalen-emsley-Bkci_8qcdvQ-unsplash.jpg"
            alt="photo of mountain scenery">
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>On top of that is the dark backdrop. The topmost layer is the text in the white box.</p>
      
      <p>The code will consist of one of each of these file types: HTML, CSS, and JS. Now we’ll get into what you came here
        for:
        the code.
      </p>

    <section id="html" class="main-section">
      <header>
        <h2>HTML</h2>
      </header>
      <p>The HTML <code style="font-family:Courier New">&ltbody&gt</code> looks like this:</p>
      
      <p style="text-align:center">
        <img style="width:85%" src="img/martz-post2-modals/modal-html.png" alt="">
      </p>
      
      <p>Notice that the very last element in the <code style="font-family:Courier New">&ltbody&gt</code> is
        the
        <code style="font-family:Courier New">&ltscript&gt</code> tag for the JS file. It's important to not
        put
        this in the <code style="font-family:Courier New">&lthead&gt</code>.</p>
      
      <p>Also, you'll see that there is an empty <code style="font-family:Courier New">&ltdiv&gt</code> with
        <code style="font-family:Courier New">class=”backdrop”</code> that will serve as our backdrop,
        which is the darkened overlay that will appear to be under the modal. There is also a
        <code style="font-family:Courier New">&ltdiv&gt</code> which will serve as our modal with
        <code style="font-family:Courier New">class=”modal”</code>, that contains some text. Within the
        <code style="font-family:Courier New">&ltmain&gt</code> tag, there is a
        <code style="font-family:Courier New">&ltdiv&gt</code> containing the image we will click on to
        activate,
        or “turn on” the modal.</p>
      
      <p style="background-color:#eeeeef;border:1px solid #000;padding:5px">Note: These class names are up to you to choose.
        They should be different from each other, and they should make sense to you.</p>
